45002024	Sin	For “ the name of God is being blasphemed among the nations because of you , ” just as it is written .
55003008	Sin	Now in the way that Jan′nes and Jam′bres opposed Moses , so these also go on opposing the truth . Such men are completely corrupted in mind , disapproved as regards the faith .

44019004	Faith	Paul said : “ John baptized with the baptism in symbol of repentance , telling the people to believe in the one coming after him , that is , in Jesus . ”
61002009	Violence	So , then , Jehovah knows how to rescue people of godly devotion out of trial , but to reserve unrighteous people to be destroyed on the day of judgment ,
58011016	Grace	But now they are reaching out for a better place , that is , one belonging to heaven . Therefore , God is not ashamed of them , to be called on as their God , for he has prepared a city for them .

43003035	Faith	The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand .
61003009	Grace	Jehovah is not slow concerning his promise , as some people consider slowness , but he is patient with you because he does not desire anyone to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance .
46007007	Grace	But I wish all men were as I am . Nevertheless , each one has his own gift from God , one in this way , another in that way .
46014001	Recommendation	Pursue love , yet keep striving for the spiritual gifts , but preferably that you may prophesy .
47004006	Grace	For God is the one who said : “ Let the light shine out of darkness , ” and he has shone on our hearts to illuminate them with the glorious knowledge of God by the face of Christ .
44018024	Description	Now a Jew named A·pol′los , a native of Alexandria , arrived in Eph′e·sus ; he was an eloquent man who was well-versed in the Scriptures .

43017024	Grace	Father , I want those whom you have given me to be with me where I am , in order that they may look upon my glory that you have given me , because you loved me before the founding of the world .
45003016	Sin	“ Ruin and misery are in their ways ,
58004014	Faith	Therefore , since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens , Jesus the Son of God , let us hold on to our public declaration of him .
61001017	Grace	For he received from God the Father honor and glory when words such as these were conveyed to him by the magnificent glory : “ This is my Son , my beloved , whom I myself have approved . ”

44018017	Violence	So they all seized Sos′the·nes , the presiding officer of the synagogue , and began beating him in front of the judgment seat . But Gal′li·o would not get involved at all with these things .
43010039	Violence	So they tried again to seize him , but he escaped from their reach .

48006002	Recommendation	Go on carrying the burdens of one another , and in this way you will fulfill the law of the Christ .
59002024	Faith	You see that a man is to be declared righteous by works and not by faith alone .
45009014	Faith	What are we to say , then ? Is there injustice with God ? Certainly not !
45014001	Recommendation	Welcome the man having weaknesses in his faith , but do not pass judgment on differing opinions .
66012007	Violence	And war broke out in heaven : Mi′cha·el and his angels battled with the dragon , and the dragon and its angels battled
49004026	Recommendation	Be wrathful , but do not sin ; do not let the sun set while you are still angry ;

62003001	Grace	See what sort of love the Father has given us , that we should be called children of God ! And that is what we are . That is why the world does not know us , because it has not come to know him .
60005005	Recommendation	In the same way , you younger men , be in subjection to the older men . But all of you clothe yourselves with humility toward one another , because God opposes the haughty ones , but he gives undeserved kindness to the humble ones .

54005016	Recommendation	If any believing woman has relatives who are widows , let her assist them so that the congregation is not burdened . Then it can assist those who are truly widows .

66016006	Sin	because they poured out the blood of holy ones and of prophets , and you have given them blood to drink ; they deserve it . ”
45006002	Sin	Certainly not ! Seeing that we died with reference to sin , how can we keep living any longer in it ?

46008003	Faith	But if anyone loves God , this one is known by him .
45003009	Sin	What then ? Are we in a better position ? Not at all ! For above we have made the charge that Jews as well as Greeks are all under sin ;
44007041	Sin	So they made a calf in those days and brought a sacrifice to the idol and began to enjoy themselves in the works of their hands .
66009020	Sin	But the rest of the people who were not killed by these plagues did not repent of the works of their hands ; they did not stop worshipping the demons and the idols of gold and silver and copper and stone and wood , which can neither see nor hear nor walk .

47003012	Faith	Since we have such a hope , we are using great freeness of speech ,
61002012	Sin	But these men , like unreasoning animals that act on instinct and are born to be caught and destroyed , speak abusively about things of which they are ignorant . They will suffer destruction brought on by their own destructive course ,

66006008	Violence	And I saw , and look ! a pale horse , and the one seated on it had the name Death . And the Grave was closely following him .

62003007	Recommendation	Little children , let no one mislead you ; the one who practices righteousness is righteous , just as that one is righteous .
62004001	Recommendation	Beloved ones , do not believe every inspired statement , but test the inspired statements to see whether they originate with God , for many false prophets have gone out into the world .
44013038	Grace	“ Let it therefore be known to you , brothers , that through this one a forgiveness of sins is being proclaimed to you ,
50003001	Recommendation	Finally , my brothers , continue rejoicing in the Lord . It is not troublesome for me to write the same things to you , and it is for your safety .
46011034	Recommendation	If anyone is hungry , let him eat at home , so that when you come together it is not for judgment . But as for the remaining matters , I will put them in order when I get there .
43018031	Description	So Pilate said to them : “ Take him yourselves and judge him according to your law . ” The Jews said to him : “ It is not lawful for us to kill anyone . ”
46012031	Faith	But keep striving for the greater gifts . And yet I will show you a surpassing way .
58007026	Description	For it is fitting for us to have such a high priest who is loyal , innocent , undefiled , separated from the sinners , and exalted above the heavens .
50004013	Faith	For all things I have the strength through the one who gives me power .
52004003	Recommendation	For this is the will of God , that you should be holy and abstain from sexual immorality .
51004002	Recommendation	Persevere in prayer , remaining awake in it with thanksgiving .
44007029	Description	On hearing this , Moses fled and lived as a foreigner in the land of Mid′i·an , where he became the father of two sons .
46011007	Description	For a man should not have his head covered , as he is God’s image and glory , but the woman is man’s glory .
51003015	Faith	Also , let the peace of the Christ rule in your hearts , for you were called to that peace in one body . And show yourselves thankful .
58002010	Grace	For it was fitting that the one for whom and through whom all things exist , in bringing many sons to glory , should make the Chief Agent of their salvation perfect through sufferings .
59004001	Sin	What is the source of the wars and fights among you ? Do they not originate from your fleshly desires that carry on a conflict within you ?
46005001	Sin	Actually sexual immorality is reported among you , and such immorality as is not even found among the nations — of a man living with his father’s wife .
46010013	Faith	No temptation has come upon you except what is common to men . But God is faithful , and he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear , but along with the temptation he will also make the way out so that you may be able to endure it .
44020029	Violence	I know that after my going away oppressive wolves will enter in among you and will not treat the flock with tenderness ,
53001004	Faith	As a result we ourselves take pride in you among the congregations of God because of your endurance and faith in all your persecutions and the hardships that you are suffering .
62004012	Faith	No one has seen God at any time . If we continue loving one another , God remains in us and his love is made perfect in us .
48001001	Description	Paul , an apostle , neither from men nor through a man , but through Jesus Christ and God the Father , who raised him up from the dead ,
58012003	Recommendation	Indeed , consider closely the one who has endured such hostile speech from sinners against their own interests , so that you may not get tired and give up .
45006005	Faith	If we have become united with him in the likeness of his death , we will certainly also be united with him in the likeness of his resurrection .
45015010	Recommendation	And again he says : “ Be glad , you nations , with his people . ”
54004001	Sin	However , the inspired word clearly says that in later times some will fall away from the faith , paying attention to misleading inspired statements and teachings of demons ,
56003001	Recommendation	Continue reminding them to be in subjection and to be obedient to governments and authorities , to be ready for every good work ,
61003005	Sin	For they deliberately ignore this fact , that long ago there were heavens and an earth standing firmly out of water and in the midst of water by the word of God ;
60003018	Grace	For Christ died once for all time for sins , a righteous person for unrighteous ones , in order to lead you to God . He was put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit .
61002021	Sin	It would have been better for them not to have accurately known the path of righteousness than after knowing it to turn away from the holy commandment they had received .
53003006	Recommendation	Now we are giving you instructions , brothers , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , to withdraw from every brother who is walking disorderly and not according to the tradition that you received from us .
45005012	Sin	That is why , just as through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin , and so death spread to all men because they had all sinned — .
58011033	Faith	Through faith they defeated kingdoms , brought about righteousness , obtained promises , stopped the mouths of lions ,
47004009	Faith	we are persecuted , but not abandoned ; we are knocked down , but not destroyed .
59004004	Sin	Adulteresses , do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God ? Whoever , therefore , wants to be a friend of the world is making himself an enemy of God .
44016006	Description	Moreover , they traveled through Phryg′i·a and the country of Ga·la′ti·a , because they were forbidden by the holy spirit to speak the word in the province of Asia .

66016002	Violence	The first one went off and poured out his bowl on the earth . And a hurtful and malignant ulcer afflicted the people who had the mark of the wild beast and who were worshipping its image .
66005008	Description	When he took the scroll , the four living creatures and the 24 elders fell down before the Lamb , and each one had a harp and golden bowls that were full of incense . ( The incense means the prayers of the holy ones . )
62005001	Faith	Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born from God , and everyone who loves the one who caused to be born loves him who has been born from that one .
48005026	Recommendation	Let us not become egotistical , stirring up competition with one another , envying one another .
54005001	Recommendation	Do not severely criticize an older man . On the contrary , appeal to him as a father , to younger men as brothers ,
60002012	Recommendation	Maintain your conduct fine among the nations , so that when they accuse you of being wrongdoers , they may be eyewitnesses of your fine works and , as a result , glorify God in the day of his inspection .

43004052	Description	So he asked them at what hour he got better . They replied to him : “ The fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour . ”
43019031	Violence	Since it was the day of Preparation , so that the bodies would not remain on the torture stakes on the Sabbath ( for that Sabbath day was a great one ) , the Jews asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken away .
43019012	Description	For this reason Pilate kept trying to find a way to release him , but the Jews shouted : “ If you release this man , you are not a friend of Caesar . Everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar . ”
43014001	Faith	“ Do not let your hearts be troubled . Exercise faith in God ; exercise faith also in me .
50001028	Faith	and in no way being frightened by your opponents . This very thing is a proof of destruction for them , but of salvation for you ; and this is from God .
43015016	Grace	You did not choose me , but I chose you , and I appointed you to go and keep bearing fruit and that your fruit should remain , so that no matter what you ask the Father in my name , he may give it to you .
58011004	Faith	By faith Abel offered God a sacrifice of greater worth than that of Cain , and through that faith he received the witness that he was righteous , for God approved his gifts , and although he died , he still speaks through his faith .
46004001	Recommendation	A man should regard us as attendants of Christ and stewards of God’s sacred secrets .
66006013	Description	and the stars of heaven fell to the earth as when a fig tree shaken by a high wind drops its unripe figs .
46010014	Recommendation	Therefore , my beloved ones , flee from idolatry .
45012021	Recommendation	Do not let yourself be conquered by the evil , but keep conquering the evil with the good .
55002014	Recommendation	Keep reminding them of these things , instructing them before God not to fight about words , something of no usefulness at all because it harms those listening .
59004008	Recommendation	Draw close to God , and he will draw close to you . Cleanse your hands , you sinners , and purify your hearts , you indecisive ones .
59002009	Sin	But if you continue showing favoritism , you are committing sin , and you are convicted by the law as transgressors .
52004007	Grace	For God has called us , not for uncleanness , but for holiness .
45001018	Sin	For God’s wrath is being revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who are suppressing the truth in an unrighteous way ,
62004007	Faith	Beloved ones , let us continue loving one another , because love is from God , and everyone who loves has been born from God and knows God .
62002009	Sin	The one who says that he is in the light and yet hates his brother is still in the darkness .
60004014	Grace	If you are being reproached for the name of Christ , you are happy , because the spirit of glory , yes , the spirit of God , is resting upon you .
44021019	Grace	And he greeted them and began giving a detailed account of the things God did among the nations through his ministry .
43008046	Sin	Who of you convicts me of sin ? If I speak truth , why is it that you do not believe me ?
58010017	Grace	Then it says : “ And I will no longer call their sins and their lawless deeds to mind . ”
46001005	Grace	because in everything you have been enriched in him , in full ability to speak and in full knowledge ,
45015030	Recommendation	Now I urge you , brothers , through our Lord Jesus Christ and through the love of the spirit , that you exert yourselves with me in prayers to God for me ,
43007020	Violence	The crowd answered : “ You have a demon . Who is seeking to kill you ? ”
45003025	Grace	God presented him as an offering for propitiation through faith in his blood . This was to demonstrate his own righteousness , because God in his forbearance was forgiving the sins that occurred in the past .
43018018	Description	Now the slaves and the officers were standing around a charcoal fire they had made , because it was cold and they were warming themselves . Peter also was standing with them and warming himself .
49006011	Recommendation	Put on the complete suit of armor from God so that you may be able to stand firm against the crafty acts of the Devil ;
43013037	Faith	Peter said to him : “ Lord , why is it I cannot follow you now ? I will surrender my life in your behalf . ”
50004007	Faith	and the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your mental powers by means of Christ Jesus .
59003009	Faith	With it we praise Jehovah , the Father , and yet with it we curse men who have come into existence “ in the likeness of God . ”
46005010	Sin	not meaning entirely with the sexually immoral people of this world or the greedy people or extortioners or idolaters . Otherwise , you would actually have to get out of the world .
44026009	Sin	I , for one , was convinced that I should commit many acts of opposition against the name of Jesus the Naz·a·rene′ .

46009014	Recommendation	In this way , too , the Lord commanded for those proclaiming the good news to live by means of the good news .
43012046	Grace	I have come as a light into the world , so that everyone putting faith in me may not remain in the darkness .
43005014	Description	After this Jesus found him in the temple and said to him : “ See , you have become well . Do not sin anymore , so that something worse does not happen to you . ”
46016014	Recommendation	Let everything you do be done with love .
43014015	Recommendation	“ If you love me , you will observe my commandments .
58012025	Recommendation	See that you do not refuse to listen to the one who is speaking . For if those who refused to listen to the one giving divine warning on earth did not escape , how much more will we not escape if we turn away from him who speaks from the heavens !
48004008	Sin	Nevertheless , when you did not know God , you were enslaved to those who are not really gods .
44003026	Grace	God , after raising up his Servant , sent him to you first to bless you by turning each one of you away from your wicked deeds . ”
44010039	Violence	And we are witnesses of all the things he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem ; but they did away with him by hanging him on a stake .
46001010	Recommendation	Now I urge you , brothers , through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that you should all speak in agreement and that there should be no divisions among you , but that you may be completely united in the same mind and in the same line of thought .
51001021	Sin	Indeed , you who were once alienated and enemies because your minds were on the works that were wicked ,
55002022	Recommendation	So flee from youthful desires , but pursue righteousness , faith , love , peace , along with those who call on the Lord out of a clean heart .
51003001	Faith	If , however , you were raised up with the Christ , go on seeking the things above , where the Christ is seated at the right hand of God .
66008007	Violence	The first one blew his trumpet . And there was hail and fire mingled with blood , and it was hurled to the earth ; and a third of the earth was burned up , and a third of the trees were burned up , and all the green vegetation was burned up .
66011017	Faith	saying : “ We thank you , Jehovah God , the Almighty , the one who is and who was , because you have taken your great power and begun ruling as king .
43004010	Grace	In answer Jesus said to her : “ If you had known of the free gift of God and who it is who says to you , ‘ Give me a drink , ’ you would have asked him , and he would have given you living water . ”
51003004	Grace	When the Christ , our life , is made manifest , then you also will be made manifest with him in glory .
43020031	Faith	But these have been written down so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God , and because of believing , you may have life by means of his name .
62004006	Faith	We originate with God . Whoever comes to know God listens to us ; whoever does not originate with God does not listen to us . By this we distinguish the inspired statement of truth from the inspired statement of error .
65001012	Description	These are the rocks hidden below water at your love feasts while they feast with you , shepherds who feed themselves without fear ; waterless clouds carried here and there by the wind ; fruitless trees in late autumn , having died twice and having been uprooted ;
44005015	Description	They even brought the sick out into the main streets and laid them there on small beds and mats , so that as Peter would pass by , at least his shadow might fall on some of them .

51003023	Recommendation	Whatever you are doing , work at it whole-souled as for Jehovah , and not for men ,
58012016	Recommendation	and watch that among you there is no one who is sexually immoral nor anyone who does not appreciate sacred things , like E′sau , who gave up his rights as firstborn in exchange for one meal .
43018040	Sin	Again they shouted : “ Not this man , but Bar·ab′bas ! ” Now Bar·ab′bas was a robber .
55003004	Sin	betrayers , headstrong , puffed up with pride , lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God ,
50002009	Grace	For this very reason , God exalted him to a superior position and kindly gave him the name that is above every other name ,
61001016	Description	No , it was not by following artfully contrived false stories that we made known to you the power and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ , but rather , we were eyewitnesses of his magnificence .
61003016	Sin	speaking about these things as he does in all his letters . However , some things in them are hard to understand , and these things the ignorant and unstable are twisting , as they do also the rest of the Scriptures , to their own destruction .
44014014	Description	However , when the apostles Bar′na·bas and Paul heard of it , they ripped their garments and leaped out into the crowd and cried out :
45015008	Faith	For I tell you that Christ became a minister of those who are circumcised in behalf of God’s truthfulness , so as to verify the promises He made to their forefathers ,
59001026	Sin	If any man thinks he is a worshipper of God but does not keep a tight rein on his tongue , he is deceiving his own heart , and his worship is futile .
43015020	Recommendation	Keep in mind the word I said to you : A slave is not greater than his master . If they have persecuted me , they will also persecute you ; if they have observed my word , they will also observe yours .
43008031	Faith	Then Jesus went on to say to the Jews who had believed him : “ If you remain in my word , you are really my disciples ,
44007011	Description	But a famine came on all of Egypt and Ca′naan , yes , a great tribulation , and our forefathers could not find anything to eat .
63001004	Faith	I rejoice very much because I have found some of your children walking in the truth , just as we received commandment from the Father .
54005008	Faith	Certainly if anyone does not provide for those who are his own , and especially for those who are members of his household , he has disowned the faith and is worse than a person without faith .
58010022	Faith	let us approach with sincere hearts and complete faith , having had our hearts sprinkled clean from a wicked conscience and our bodies bathed with clean water .
48001023	Description	They only used to hear : “ The man who formerly persecuted us is now declaring the good news about the faith that he formerly devastated . ”
44027034	Recommendation	So I encourage you to eat some food ; this is in the interests of your safety , for not a hair of the head of any one of you will perish . ”
66002003	Faith	You are also showing endurance , and you have persevered for the sake of my name and have not grown weary .
56002002	Recommendation	Let the older men be moderate in habits , serious , sound in mind , healthy in faith , in love , in endurance .
44017030	Recommendation	True , God has overlooked the times of such ignorance ; but now he is declaring to all people everywhere that they should repent .

66019013	Description	and he is clothed with an outer garment stained with blood , and he is called by the name The Word of God .
46008009	Recommendation	But keep watching that your right to choose does not somehow become a stumbling block to those who are weak .
44013034	Grace	And the fact that He resurrected him from the dead never again to return to corruption , He has stated in this way : ‘ I will give you the expressions of loyal love promised to David , which are faithful . ’
43014020	Faith	In that day you will know that I am in union with my Father and you are in union with me and I am in union with you .
62002003	Faith	And by this we realize that we have come to know him , namely , if we continue observing his commandments .
43008024	Sin	That is why I said to you : You will die in your sins . For if you do not believe that I am the one , you will die in your sins . ”
66017006	Sin	And I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the holy ones and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus . Well , on seeing her I was greatly amazed .
58012017	Description	For you know that afterward when he wanted to inherit the blessing , he was rejected ; for although he earnestly tried to bring about a change of mind with tears , it was to no avail .
43007012	Description	And there was a lot of subdued talk about him among the crowds . Some would say : “ He is a good man . ” Others would say : “ He is not . He misleads the crowd . ”
44011021	Faith	Furthermore , the hand of Jehovah was with them , and a great number became believers and turned to the Lord .
52002004	Faith	but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the good news , so we speak to please , not men , but God , who examines our hearts .
46015057	Grace	But thanks to God , for he gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ !

46007021	Recommendation	Were you called when a slave ? Do not let it concern you ; but if you can become free , then seize the opportunity .
65001019	Sin	These are the ones who cause divisions , animalistic men , not having spirituality .
48001006	Sin	I am amazed that you are so quickly turning away from the One who called you with Christ’s undeserved kindness to another sort of good news .
58012014	Recommendation	Pursue peace with all people and the sanctification without which no man will see the Lord .
43021006	Description	He said to them : “ Cast the net on the right side of the boat and you will find some . ” So they cast it , but they were not able to haul it in because of the large number of fish .
46007019	Recommendation	Circumcision means nothing , and uncircumcision means nothing ; what means something is the observing of God’s commandments .
45012008	Recommendation	or the one who encourages , let him give encouragement ; the one who distributes , let him do it liberally ; the one who presides , let him do it diligently ; the one who shows mercy , let him do it cheerfully .
44019002	Faith	and said to them : “ Did you receive holy spirit when you became believers ? ” They replied to him : “ Why , we have never heard that there is a holy spirit . ”
53003014	Recommendation	But if anyone is not obedient to our word through this letter , keep this one marked and stop associating with him , so that he may become ashamed .
46015050	Sin	But I tell you this , brothers , that flesh and blood cannot inherit God’s Kingdom , nor does corruption inherit incorruption .
43006027	Recommendation	Work , not for the food that perishes , but for the food that remains for everlasting life , which the Son of man will give you ; for on this one the Father , God himself , has put his seal of approval . ”

49005020	Faith	always giving thanks to our God and Father for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ .
48003006	Faith	Just as Abraham “ put faith in Jehovah , and it was counted to him as righteousness . ”
66021023	Grace	And the city has no need of the sun nor of the moon to shine on it , for the glory of God illuminated it , and its lamp was the Lamb .
45008009	Faith	However , you are in harmony , not with the flesh , but with the spirit , if God’s spirit truly dwells in you . But if anyone does not have Christ’s spirit , this person does not belong to him .
45011023	Faith	And they also , if they do not remain in their lack of faith , will be grafted in , for God is able to graft them back in .
66014005	Description	and no deceit was found in their mouths ; they are without blemish .
44024014	Faith	But I do admit this to you , that according to the way that they call a sect , in this manner I am rendering sacred service to the God of my forefathers , as I believe all the things set forth in the Law and written in the Prophets .
45013008	Recommendation	Do not owe anything to anyone except to love one another ; for whoever loves his fellow man has fulfilled the law .

48003013	Grace	Christ purchased us , releasing us from the curse of the Law by becoming a curse instead of us , because it is written : “ Accursed is every man hung upon a stake . ”
48001013	Sin	Of course , you heard about my conduct formerly in Ju′da·ism , that I kept intensely persecuting the congregation of God and devastating it ;
66020002	Description	He seized the dragon , the original serpent , who is the Devil and Satan , and bound him for 1000 years .
44008009	Description	Now in the city was a man named Simon , who prior to this had been practicing magical arts and amazing the nation of Sa·mar′i·a , claiming that he was somebody great .
50003010	Faith	My aim is to know him and the power of his resurrection and to share in his sufferings , submitting myself to a death like his ,
54005022	Recommendation	Never lay your hands hastily on any man ; neither become a sharer in the sins of others ; keep yourself chaste .
56002003	Recommendation	Likewise , let the older women be reverent in behavior , not slanderous , not enslaved to a lot of wine , teachers of what is good ,
46007038	Recommendation	So also , whoever marries does well , but whoever does not marry will do better .
59001022	Recommendation	However , become doers of the word and not hearers only , deceiving yourselves with false reasoning .
43007001	Violence	After this Jesus continued traveling about in Gal′i·lee , for he did not want to do so in Ju·de′a because the Jews were seeking to kill him .

43007043	Description	So a division over him arose among the crowd .
60005002	Recommendation	Shepherd the flock of God under your care , serving as overseers , not under compulsion , but willingly before God ; not for love of dishonest gain , but eagerly ;
46015056	Sin	The sting producing death is sin , and the power for sin is the Law .
59005004	Sin	Look ! The wages you have withheld from the workers who harvested your fields keep crying out , and the cries for help of the reapers have reached the ears of Jehovah of armies .
60002001	Recommendation	So rid yourselves of all badness and deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all backbiting .
46007039	Recommendation	A wife is bound as long as her husband is alive . But if her husband should fall asleep in death , she is free to be married to whomever she wants , only in the Lord .

65001017	Recommendation	As for you , beloved ones , call to mind the sayings that have been previously spoken by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
44017025	Grace	nor is he served by human hands as if he needed anything , because he himself gives to all people life and breath and all things .
62005009	Faith	If we accept the witness of men , the witness of God is greater . Because this is the witness God gives , the witness that he has given about his Son .
45013014	Faith	But put on the Lord Jesus Christ , and do not be planning ahead for the desires of the flesh .
58011030	Description	By faith the walls of Jer′i·cho fell down after the people had marched around them for seven days .
44019011	Grace	And God kept performing extraordinary powerful works through the hands of Paul ,
43008034	Sin	Jesus answered them : “ Most truly I say to you , every doer of sin is a slave of sin .
62004011	Faith	Beloved ones , if this is how God loved us , then we are also under obligation to love one another .
44002028	Grace	You have made life’s ways known to me ; you will fill me with great joy in your presence . ’
54004013	Recommendation	Until I come , continue applying yourself to public reading , to exhortation , to teaching .
47004008	Description	We are hard-pressed in every way , but not cramped beyond movement ; we are perplexed , but not absolutely with no way out ;
44002013	Description	However , others mocked them and said : “ They are full of sweet wine . ”
66021018	Description	Now the wall was made of jasper , and the city was pure gold like clear glass .

45008032	Grace	Since he did not even spare his own Son but handed him over for us all , will he not also , along with him , kindly give us all other things ?
65001018	Sin	how they used to say to you : “ In the last time there will be ridiculers , following their own desires for ungodly things . ”
45011018	Recommendation	do not be arrogant toward the branches . If , though , you are arrogant toward them , remember that it is not you who bears the root , but the root bears you .
47001024	Faith	Not that we are the masters over your faith , but we are fellow workers for your joy , for it is by your faith that you are standing .
43011001	Description	Now a man named Laz′a·rus was sick ; he was from Beth′a·ny , the village of Mary and her sister Martha .
52004008	Sin	So , then , the man who disregards this is disregarding , not man , but God , who gives you his holy spirit .
62004002	Faith	This is how you know that the inspired statement is from God : Every inspired statement that acknowledges Jesus Christ as having come in the flesh originates with God .
65001008	Sin	Despite this , these men too are indulging in dreams , defiling the flesh , despising authority , and speaking abusively of glorious ones .
60003011	Recommendation	Let him turn away from what is bad and do what is good ; let him seek peace and pursue it .
51001023	Faith	provided , of course , that you continue in the faith , established on the foundation and steadfast , not being shifted away from the hope of that good news that you heard and that was preached in all creation under heaven . Of this good news I , Paul , became a minister .

49004024	Recommendation	and should put on the new personality that was created according to God’s will in true righteousness and loyalty .

44013030	Description	But God raised him up from the dead ,
43010011	Description	I am the fine shepherd ; the fine shepherd surrenders his life in behalf of the sheep .

43010019	Description	A division again resulted among the Jews because of these words .

47004014	Faith	knowing that the One who raised Jesus up will raise us up also with Jesus and will present us together with you .

44019029	Description	So the city became filled with confusion , and all together they rushed into the theater , dragging along with them Ga′ius and Ar·is·tar′chus , Mac·e·do′ni·ans , traveling companions of Paul .
44003014	Sin	Yes , you disowned that holy and righteous one , and you asked for a man who was a murderer to be given to you ,
44015009	Faith	And he made no distinction at all between us and them , but purified their hearts by faith .
46011028	Recommendation	First let a man approve himself after scrutiny , and only then let him eat of the loaf and drink of the cup .
46015058	Faith	Therefore , my beloved brothers , be steadfast , immovable , always having plenty to do in the work of the Lord , knowing that your labor is not in vain in connection with the Lord .
46004016	Recommendation	I urge you , therefore , become imitators of me .
46001021	Faith	For since , in the wisdom of God , the world did not get to know God through its wisdom , God was pleased through the foolishness of what is preached to save those believing .
60003001	Recommendation	In the same way , you wives , be in subjection to your husbands , so that if any are not obedient to the word , they may be won without a word through the conduct of their wives ,
47005020	Recommendation	Therefore , we are ambassadors substituting for Christ , as though God were making an appeal through us . As substitutes for Christ , we beg : “ Become reconciled to God . ”
44002024	Description	But God resurrected him by releasing him from the pangs of death , because it was not possible for him to be held fast by it .

59002008	Recommendation	If , now , you carry out the royal law according to the scripture , “ You must love your neighbor as yourself , ” you are doing quite well .
47004005	Faith	For we are preaching , not about ourselves , but about Jesus Christ as Lord and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus ’ sake .
46015033	Recommendation	Do not be misled . Bad associations spoil useful habits .
58013020	Grace	Now may the God of peace , who brought up from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep , our Lord Jesus , with the blood of an everlasting covenant ,
50001027	Recommendation	Only behave in a manner worthy of the good news about the Christ , so that whether I come and see you or I am absent , I may hear about you and learn that you are standing firm in one spirit , with one soul , striving side by side for the faith of the good news ,
46006014	Grace	But God raised up the Lord and will also raise us up out of death through his power .
55001006	Recommendation	For this reason I remind you to stir up like a fire the gift of God that is in you through the laying of my hands on you .
60004006	Grace	In fact , this is why the good news was declared also to the dead , so that although they are judged in the flesh from the standpoint of men , they might live in harmony with the spirit from God’s standpoint .
46007023	Recommendation	You were bought with a price ; stop becoming slaves of men .
46010010	Recommendation	Neither be murmurers , as some of them murmured , only to perish by the destroyer .
47002017	Faith	We are , for we are not peddlers of the word of God as many men are , but we speak in all sincerity as sent from God , yes , in the sight of God and in company with Christ .
45015001	Recommendation	We , though , who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of those not strong , and not to be pleasing ourselves .
50002024	Faith	Indeed , I am confident in the Lord that I myself will also come soon .
66007001	Description	After this I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth , holding tight the four winds of the earth , so that no wind could blow on the earth or on the sea or on any tree .
60004003	Sin	For the time that has passed by is sufficient for you to have done the will of the nations when you carried on in acts of brazen conduct , unbridled passions , overdrinking , wild parties , drinking bouts , and lawless idolatries .
66011005	Violence	If anyone wants to harm them , fire comes out of their mouths and consumes their enemies . If anyone should want to harm them , this is how he must be killed .
44023005	Recommendation	And Paul said : “ Brothers , I did not know he was high priest . For it is written , ‘ You must not speak injuriously of a ruler of your people . ’ ”
66022015	Sin	Outside are the dogs and those who practice spiritism and those who are sexually immoral and the murderers and the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices lying . ’
66002014	Sin	“ ‘ Nevertheless , I have a few things against you , that you have there those adhering to the teaching of Ba′laam , who taught Ba′lak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel , to eat things sacrificed to idols and to commit sexual immorality .
53001003	Faith	We are obligated always to give thanks to God for you , brothers . This is fitting , because your faith is growing exceedingly and the love of each and every one of you is increasing toward one another .
46012002	Sin	You know that when you were people of the nations , you were influenced and led astray to those voiceless idols , following wherever they might lead you .
49005025	Recommendation	Husbands , continue loving your wives , just as the Christ also loved the congregation and gave himself up for it ,
45012017	Recommendation	Return evil for evil to no one . Take into consideration what is fine from the viewpoint of all men .
60005006	Recommendation	Humble yourselves , therefore , under the mighty hand of God , so that he may exalt you in due time ,
44014017	Grace	although he did not leave himself without witness in that he did good , giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons , satisfying you with food and filling your hearts with gladness . ”
54003011	Recommendation	Women should likewise be serious , not slanderous , moderate in habits , faithful in all things .
66002021	Sin	And I gave her time to repent , but she is not willing to repent of her sexual immorality .
44012020	Description	Now he was in an angry mood against the people of Tyre and Si′don . So they came to him with one purpose , and after persuading Blastus , the man in charge of the king’s household affairs , they sued for peace , because their country was supplied with food from the land of the king .
43008049	Sin	Jesus answered : “ I do not have a demon , but I honor my Father , and you dishonor me .
43006018	Description	Also , the sea was getting rough because a strong wind was blowing .
45008018	Faith	For I consider that the sufferings of the present time do not amount to anything in comparison with the glory that is going to be revealed in us .
62002012	Grace	I am writing you , little children , because your sins have been forgiven you for the sake of his name .
55001009	Grace	He saved us and called us with a holy calling , not because of our works , but because of his own purpose and undeserved kindness . This was given to us in connection with Christ Jesus before times long ago ,
43019006	Violence	However , when the chief priests and the officers saw him , they shouted : “ To the stake with him ! To the stake with him ! ” Pilate said to them : “ Take him yourselves and execute him , for I do not find any fault in him . ”
60001010	Grace	Concerning this salvation , the prophets who prophesied about the undeserved kindness meant for you made a diligent inquiry and a careful search .
63001007	Sin	For many deceivers have gone out into the world , those not acknowledging Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh . This is the deceiver and the antichrist .
44024005	Sin	For we have found this man to be a pest , stirring up seditions among all the Jews throughout the inhabited earth , and he is a spearhead of the sect of the Naz·a·renes′ .
54003016	Grace	Indeed , the sacred secret of this godly devotion is admittedly great : ‘ He was made manifest in flesh , was declared righteous in spirit , appeared to angels , was preached about among nations , was believed upon in the world , was received up in glory . ’
66016021	Violence	Then great hailstones , each about the weight of a talent , fell from heaven on the people , and the people blasphemed God because of the plague of hail , for the plague was unusually great .
61003013	Faith	But there are new heavens and a new earth that we are awaiting according to his promise , and in these righteousness is to dwell .
66006014	Description	And the heaven departed as a scroll that is being rolled up , and every mountain and every island was removed from its place .
58010010	Grace	By this “ will ” we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all time .
52001002	Faith	We always thank God when we mention all of you in our prayers ,
66006004	Violence	Another came out , a fiery-colored horse , and it was granted to the one seated on it to take peace away from the earth so that they should slaughter one another , and he was given a great sword .
54006001	Recommendation	Let those who are under the yoke of slavery keep on considering their owners worthy of full honor , so that the name of God and the teaching may never be spoken of injuriously .
51003009	Recommendation	Do not lie to one another . Strip off the old personality with its practices ,
66002020	Sin	“ ‘ Nevertheless , I do hold this against you , that you tolerate that woman Jez′e·bel , who calls herself a prophetess , and she teaches and misleads my slaves to commit sexual immorality and to eat things sacrificed to idols .
48003008	Grace	Now the scripture , foreseeing that God would declare people of the nations righteous through faith , declared the good news beforehand to Abraham , namely : “ By means of you all the nations will be blessed . ”
58012005	Recommendation	And you have entirely forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons : “ My son , do not belittle the discipline from Jehovah , nor give up when you are corrected by him ;
58013017	Recommendation	Be obedient to those who are taking the lead among you and be submissive , for they are keeping watch over you as those who will render an account , so that they may do this with joy and not with sighing , for this would be damaging to you .
44013019	Description	After destroying seven nations in the land of Ca′naan , he assigned their land as an inheritance .
54006003	Faith	If any man teaches another doctrine and does not agree with the wholesome instruction , which is from our Lord Jesus Christ , nor with the teaching that is in harmony with godly devotion ,
63001010	Recommendation	If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching , do not receive him into your homes or say a greeting to him .
47001005	Grace	For just as the sufferings for the Christ abound in us , so the comfort we receive through the Christ also abounds .
65001011	Sin	Too bad for them , for they have followed the path of Cain and have rushed into the erroneous course of Ba′laam for reward , and they have perished in the rebellious talk of Kor′ah !
65001010	Sin	But these men are speaking abusively about all the things they really do not understand . And in all the things that they do understand by instinct like unreasoning animals , they go on corrupting themselves .
58011007	Faith	By faith Noah , after receiving divine warning of things not yet seen , showed godly fear and constructed an ark for the saving of his household ; and through this faith he condemned the world , and he became an heir of the righteousness that results from faith .
58009006	Description	After these things were constructed this way , the priests enter the first tent compartment regularly to perform the sacred services ;
44007051	Sin	“ Obstinate men and uncircumcised in hearts and ears , you are always resisting the holy spirit ; as your forefathers did , so you do .
54001009	Sin	recognizing that law is made , not for a righteous man , but for those who are lawless and rebellious , ungodly and sinners , disloyal and profane , murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers , manslayers ,
46005009	Recommendation	In my letter I wrote you to stop keeping company with sexually immoral people ,
48001015	Grace	But when God , who separated me from my mother’s womb and called me through his undeserved kindness , thought good
45007015	Description	For I do not understand what I am doing . For I do not practice what I wish , but I do what I hate .
61003018	Faith	No , but go on growing in the undeserved kindness and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ . To him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity . Amen .
46004010	Description	We are fools because of Christ , but you are discreet in Christ ; we are weak , but you are strong ; you are held in honor , but we in dishonor .
60005009	Faith	But take your stand against him , firm in the faith , knowing that the same kind of sufferings are being experienced by the entire association of your brothers in the world .
51003022	Recommendation	You slaves , be obedient in everything to those who are your human masters , not only when they are watching , just to please men , but with sincerity of heart , with fear of Jehovah .
66017012	Description	“ The ten horns that you saw mean ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom , but they do receive authority as kings for one hour with the wild beast .
46002012	Grace	Now we received , not the spirit of the world , but the spirit that is from God , so that we might know the things that have been kindly given us by God .
59005001	Recommendation	Come , now , you rich men , weep and wail over the miseries that are coming upon you .
66002010	Recommendation	Do not be afraid of the things you are about to suffer . Look ! The Devil will keep on throwing some of you into prison so that you may be fully put to the test , and you will have tribulation for ten days . Prove yourself faithful even to death , and I will give you the crown of life .
54006011	Recommendation	However , you , O man of God , flee from these things . But pursue righteousness , godly devotion , faith , love , endurance , and mildness .
59005005	Sin	You have lived in luxury and for self-gratification on the earth . You have fattened your hearts on the day of slaughter .
66004004	Description	All around the throne were 24 thrones , and on these thrones I saw seated 24 elders dressed in white garments , and on their heads golden crowns .
