43019011	Sin	Jesus answered him : “ You would have no authority over me at all unless it had been granted to you from above . This is why the man who handed me over to you has greater sin . ”
59002017	Faith	So , too , faith by itself , without works , is dead .
45008003	Sin	What the Law was incapable of doing because it was weak through the flesh , God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and concerning sin , condemned sin in the flesh ,

66018003	Sin	For because of the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality , all the nations have fallen victim , and the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality with her , and the merchants of the earth became rich owing to the power of her shameless luxury . ”
44026021	Violence	This is why the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me .
55004004	Sin	They will turn away from listening to the truth and give attention to false stories .

43013020	Faith	Most truly I say to you , whoever receives anyone I send receives me also , and whoever receives me receives also the One who sent me . ”
58012028	Faith	Therefore , seeing that we are to receive a Kingdom that cannot be shaken , let us continue to receive undeserved kindness , through which we may acceptably offer God sacred service with godly fear and awe .

58006019	Faith	We have this hope as an anchor for the soul , both sure and firm , and it enters in within the curtain ,
49005011	Recommendation	and stop sharing in the unfruitful works that belong to the darkness ; rather , expose them for what they are .
59004011	Recommendation	Stop speaking against one another , brothers . Whoever speaks against a brother or judges his brother speaks against law and judges law . Now if you judge law , you are not a doer of law but a judge .

45003027	Faith	Where , then , is the boasting ? There is no place for it . Through what law ? That of works ? No indeed , but through the law of faith .
43014010	Faith	Do you not believe that I am in union with the Father and the Father is in union with me ? The things I say to you I do not speak of my own originality , but the Father who remains in union with me is doing his works .
44016022	Violence	And the crowd rose up together against them , and the civil magistrates , after tearing the garments off them , gave the command to beat them with rods .
43013034	Recommendation	I am giving you a new commandment , that you love one another ; just as I have loved you , you also love one another .

45014014	Sin	I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself ; only where a man considers something to be unclean , to him it is unclean .
54004006	Faith	By giving this counsel to the brothers , you will be a fine minister of Christ Jesus , one nourished with the words of the faith and of the fine teaching that you have followed closely .
