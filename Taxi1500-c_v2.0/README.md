# Taxi1500-c v2.0

## Download
Version 2.0 of the Taxi1500 corpora can be downloaded via [this link](https://cis.lmu.de/~yehao/data/Taxi1500-c_v2.0.zip).

## Description
Version 2.0 includes everything in [v1.0](../Taxi1500-c_v1.0/), with additional editions which are found to be distributable.

### Manual translation ID matching
Many of the crawled files do not contain a translation ID. At the same time, many translation IDs cannot be assigned to files under 1000Langs.

For the "leftover" translations that are distributable, we manually check if they actually correspond to the editions under 1000Langs and include the positive ones in the released corpus.

### Additional crawling
A portion of the free Bibles on ebible cannot be matched to our current crawled data. To maximize the coverage, we crawl and distribute these editions.
