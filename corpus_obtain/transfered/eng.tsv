46014001	Recommendation	Follow after charity , and desire spiritual gifts , but rather that ye may prophesy .

51004005	Recommendation	Walk in wisdom toward them that are without , redeeming the time .
45006006	Faith	Knowing this , that our old man is crucified with him , that the body of sin might be destroyed , that henceforth we should not serve sin .
62003010	Sin	In this the children of God are manifest , and the children of the devil : whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God , neither he that loveth not his brother .
45008007	Sin	Because the carnal mind is enmity against God : for it is not subject to the law of God , neither indeed can be .
44002026	Faith	Therefore did my heart rejoice , and my tongue was glad ; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope :
46010020	Sin	But I say , that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice , they sacrifice to devils , and not to God : and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils .
44013001	Description	Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers ; as Barnabas , and Simeon that was called Niger , and Lucius of Cyrene , and Manaen , which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch , and Saul .

56001011	Sin	Whose mouths must be stopped , who subvert whole houses , teaching things which they ought not , for filthy lucre's sake .
43013011	Sin	For he knew who should betray him ; therefore said he , Ye are not all clean .
43010001	Sin	Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold , but climbeth up some other way , the same is a thief and a robber .
61002015	Sin	Which have forsaken the right way , and are gone astray , following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor , who loved the wages of unrighteousness ;

43021017	Description	He saith unto him the third time , Simon , son of Jonas , lovest thou me ? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time , Lovest thou me ? And he said unto him , Lord , thou knowest all things ; thou knowest that I love thee . Jesus saith unto him , Feed my sheep .
66021027	Sin	And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth , neither whatsoever worketh abomination , or maketh a lie : but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life .
66017004	Sin	And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour , and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls , having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication :

43012023	Description	And Jesus answered them , saying , The hour is come , that the Son of man should be glorified .
45002022	Sin	Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery , dost thou commit adultery ? thou that abhorrest idols , dost thou commit sacrilege ?
45007008	Sin	But sin , taking occasion by the commandment , wrought in me all manner of concupiscence . For without the law sin was dead .
44026017	Grace	Delivering thee from the people , and from the Gentiles , unto whom now I send thee ,
56003003	Sin	For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish , disobedient , deceived , serving divers lusts and pleasures , living in malice and envy , hateful , and hating one another .
54005021	Recommendation	I charge thee before God , and the Lord Jesus Christ , and the elect angels , that thou observe these things without preferring one before another , doing nothing by partiality .
58010035	Recommendation	Cast not away therefore your confidence , which hath great recompence of reward .
46004002	Faith	Moreover it is required in stewards , that a man be found faithful .
44009043	Description	And it came to pass , that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner .
46003016	Grace	Know ye not that ye are the temple of God , and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you ?
58010019	Faith	Having therefore , brethren , boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus ,
43008021	Sin	Then said Jesus again unto them , I go my way , and ye shall seek me , and shall die in your sins : whither I go , ye cannot come .
51003012	Recommendation	Put on therefore , as the elect of God , holy and beloved , bowels of mercies , kindness , humbleness of mind , meekness , longsuffering ;

62003011	Recommendation	For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning , that we should love one another .
46007026	Recommendation	I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress , I say , that it is good for a man so to be .
43003001	Description	There was a man of the Pharisees , named Nicodemus , a ruler of the Jews :
59002025	Description	Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works , when she had received the messengers , and had sent them out another way ?
54002015	Faith	Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing , if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety .
44013017	Grace	The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers , and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt , and with an high arm brought he them out of it .
44015008	Grace	And God , which knoweth the hearts , bare them witness , giving them the Holy Ghost , even as he did unto us ;
59002011	Sin	For he that said , Do not commit adultery , said also , Do not kill . Now if thou commit no adultery , yet if thou kill , thou art become a transgressor of the law .
43010028	Grace	And I give unto them eternal life ; and they shall never perish , neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand .
45016020	Grace	And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly . The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you . Amen .

45012005	Description	So we , being many , are one body in Christ , and every one members one of another .
56003008	Faith	This is a faithful saying , and these things I will that thou affirm constantly , that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works . These things are good and profitable unto men .
59002023	Faith	And the scripture was fulfilled which saith , Abraham believed God , and it was imputed unto him for righteousness : and he was called the Friend of God .
59002001	Faith	My brethren , have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Lord of glory , with respect of persons .
45003013	Sin	Their throat is an open sepulchre ; with their tongues they have used deceit ; the poison of asps is under their lips :
49005028	Recommendation	So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies . He that loveth his wife loveth himself .
45009030	Faith	What shall we say then ? That the Gentiles , which followed not after righteousness , have attained to righteousness , even the righteousness which is of faith .
54003009	Faith	Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience .
54006002	Recommendation	And they that have believing masters , let them not despise them , because they are brethren ; but rather do them service , because they are faithful and beloved , partakers of the benefit . These things teach and exhort .
45003003	Faith	For what if some did not believe ? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect ?
43019034	Violence	But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side , and forthwith came there out blood and water .
43015012	Recommendation	This is my commandment , That ye love one another , as I have loved you .

52002015	Violence	Who both killed the Lord Jesus , and their own prophets , and have persecuted us ; and they please not God , and are contrary to all men :

49002006	Grace	And hath raised us up together , and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus :
49004025	Recommendation	Wherefore putting away lying , speak every man truth with his neighbour : for we are members one of another .
48002005	Faith	To whom we gave place by subjection , no , not for an hour ; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you .
46014013	Recommendation	Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret .

44018003	Description	And because he was of the same craft , he abode with them , and wrought : for by their occupation they were tentmakers .
45006012	Sin	Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body , that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof .
53003012	Recommendation	Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ , that with quietness they work , and eat their own bread .
44007009	Sin	And the patriarchs , moved with envy , sold Joseph into Egypt : but God was with him ,
44011028	Description	And there stood up one of them named Agabus , and signified by the spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world : which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar .

62001006	Sin	If we say that we have fellowship with him , and walk in darkness , we lie , and do not the truth :

44002009	Description	Parthians , and Medes , and Elamites , and the dwellers in Mesopotamia , and in Judaea , and Cappadocia , in Pontus , and Asia ,
51001010	Faith	That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing , being fruitful in every good work , and increasing in the knowledge of God ;
54001018	Recommendation	This charge I commit unto thee , son Timothy , according to the prophecies which went before on thee , that thou by them mightest war a good warfare ;
66019001	Faith	And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven , saying , Alleluia ; Salvation , and glory , and honour , and power , unto the Lord our God :
49002001	Grace	And you hath he quickened , who were dead in trespasses and sins ;
46010021	Sin	Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord , and the cup of devils : ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table , and of the table of devils .
49005003	Recommendation	But fornication , and all uncleanness , or covetousness , let it not be once named among you , as becometh saints ;
56001015	Sin	Unto the pure all things are pure : but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure ; but even their mind and conscience is defiled .
44009021	Description	But all that heard him were amazed , and said ; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem , and came hither for that intent , that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests ?
58008006	Description	But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry , by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant , which was established upon better promises .
50001021	Faith	For to me to live is Christ , and to die is gain .
50001006	Faith	Being confident of this very thing , that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ :
62005020	Faith	And we know that the Son of God is come , and hath given us an understanding , that we may know him that is true , and we are in him that is true , even in his Son Jesus Christ . This is the true God , and eternal life .

58010023	Faith	Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering ; ( for he is faithful that promised ; )

47005006	Faith	Therefore we are always confident , knowing that , whilst we are at home in the body , we are absent from the Lord :
43012047	Grace	And if any man hear my words , and believe not , I judge him not : for I came not to judge the world , but to save the world .
62003012	Sin	Not as Cain , who was of that wicked one , and slew his brother . And wherefore slew he him ? Because his own works were evil , and his brother's righteous .

60002002	Faith	As newborn babes , desire the sincere milk of the word , that ye may grow thereby :
66014013	Faith	And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me , Write , Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth : Yea , saith the Spirit , that they may rest from their labours ; and their works do follow them .
59001027	Faith	Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this , To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction , and to keep himself unspotted from the world .
51002004	Recommendation	And this I say , lest any man should beguile you with enticing words .
66005013	Description	And every creature which is in heaven , and on the earth , and under the earth , and such as are in the sea , and all that are in them , heard I saying , Blessing , and honour , and glory , and power , be unto him that sitteth upon the throne , and unto the Lamb for ever and ever .

47004010	Faith	Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus , that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body .

60005004	Grace	And when the chief Shepherd shall appear , ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away .
47003012	Faith	Seeing then that we have such hope , we use great plainness of speech :
61002012	Sin	But these , as natural brute beasts , made to be taken and destroyed , speak evil of the things that they understand not ; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption ;
43012006	Sin	This he said , not that he cared for the poor ; but because he was a thief , and had the bag , and bare what was put therein .

58009015	Grace	And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament , that by means of death , for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament , they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance .
45006001	Sin	What shall we say then ? Shall we continue in sin , that grace may abound ?
49005004	Recommendation	Neither filthiness , nor foolish talking , nor jesting , which are not convenient : but rather giving of thanks .
66006008	Violence	And I looked , and behold a pale horse : and his name that sat on him was Death , and Hell followed with him . And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth , to kill with sword , and with hunger , and with death , and with the beasts of the earth .
45004016	Faith	Therefore it is of faith , that it might be by grace ; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed ; not to that only which is of the law , but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham ; who is the father of us all ,
44028018	Description	Who , when they had examined me , would have let me go , because there was no cause of death in me .

46010008	Sin	Neither let us commit fornication , as some of them committed , and fell in one day three and twenty thousand .
45007023	Sin	But I see another law in my members , warring against the law of my mind , and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members .

43020022	Faith	And when he had said this , he breathed on them , and saith unto them , Receive ye the Holy Ghost :

62005010	Faith	He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself : he that believeth not God hath made him a liar ; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son .

56002009	Recommendation	Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters , and to please them well in all things ; not answering again ;
58012015	Recommendation	Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God ; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you , and thereby many be defiled ;
54003007	Recommendation	Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without ; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil .
49004007	Grace	But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ .
66016003	Description	And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea ; and it became as the blood of a dead man : and every living soul died in the sea .

43006040	Faith	And this is the will of him that sent me , that every one which seeth the Son , and believeth on him , may have everlasting life : and I will raise him up at the last day .
44012023	Violence	And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him , because he gave not God the glory : and he was eaten of worms , and gave up the ghost .
47001003	Grace	Blessed be God , even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of mercies , and the God of all comfort ;
54001006	Sin	From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling ;
45001016	Faith	For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ : for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth ; to the Jew first , and also to the Greek .

49005033	Recommendation	Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself ; and the wife see that she reverence her husband .

62004015	Faith	Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God , God dwelleth in him , and he in God .
49004022	Recommendation	That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man , which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts ;

43011004	Faith	When Jesus heard that , he said , This sickness is not unto death , but for the glory of God , that the Son of God might be glorified thereby .
45001017	Faith	For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith : as it is written , The just shall live by faith .
43019017	Description	And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull , which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha :

57001022	Recommendation	But withal prepare me also a lodging : for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you .

46014020	Recommendation	Brethren , be not children in understanding : howbeit in malice be ye children , but in understanding be men .
59005013	Recommendation	Is any among you afflicted ? let him pray . Is any merry ? let him sing psalms .

60001017	Recommendation	And if ye call on the Father , who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work , pass the time of your sojourning here in fear :
58010036	Recommendation	For ye have need of patience , that , after ye have done the will of God , ye might receive the promise .
58011001	Faith	Now faith is the substance of things hoped for , the evidence of things not seen .
49004017	Recommendation	This I say therefore , and testify in the Lord , that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk , in the vanity of their mind ,
51002016	Recommendation	Let no man therefore judge you in meat , or in drink , or in respect of an holyday , or of the new moon , or of the sabbath days :

54005020	Recommendation	Them that sin rebuke before all , that others also may fear .
45014013	Recommendation	Let us not therefore judge one another any more : but judge this rather , that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way .
45002010	Grace	But glory , honour , and peace , to every man that worketh good , to the Jew first , and also to the Gentile :
58011034	Violence	Quenched the violence of fire , escaped the edge of the sword , out of weakness were made strong , waxed valiant in fight , turned to flight the armies of the aliens .
48006017	Faith	From henceforth let no man trouble me : for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus .
66018021	Violence	And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone , and cast it into the sea , saying , Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down , and shall be found no more at all .

45012002	Recommendation	And be not conformed to this world : but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind , that ye may prove what is that good , and acceptable , and perfect , will of God .
46015009	Sin	For I am the least of the apostles , that am not meet to be called an apostle , because I persecuted the church of God .
62002015	Recommendation	Love not the world , neither the things that are in the world . If any man love the world , the love of the Father is not in him .

47005014	Grace	For the love of Christ constraineth us ; because we thus judge , that if one died for all , then were all dead :
58003001	Faith	Wherefore , holy brethren , partakers of the heavenly calling , consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession , Christ Jesus ;
44020035	Recommendation	I have shewed you all things , how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak , and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus , how he said , It is more blessed to give than to receive .

66019010	Faith	And I fell at his feet to worship him . And he said unto me , See thou do it not : I am thy fellowservant , and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus : worship God : for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy .

50002029	Recommendation	Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness ; and hold such in reputation :
51003020	Recommendation	Children , obey your parents in all things : for this is well pleasing unto the Lord .
47001012	Faith	For our rejoicing is this , the testimony of our conscience , that in simplicity and godly sincerity , not with fleshly wisdom , but by the grace of God , we have had our conversation in the world , and more abundantly to you-ward .
43014021	Faith	He that hath my commandments , and keepeth them , he it is that loveth me : and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father , and I will love him , and will manifest myself to him .
51002023	Sin	Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship , and humility , and neglecting of the body ; not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh .
64001006	Recommendation	Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church : whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort , thou shalt do well :
55002023	Recommendation	But foolish and unlearned questions avoid , knowing that they do gender strifes .
47003018	Faith	But we all , with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord , are changed into the same image from glory to glory , even as by the Spirit of the Lord .
58009014	Grace	How much more shall the blood of Christ , who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God , purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God ?
44011017	Grace	Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us , who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ ; what was I , that I could withstand God ?
49004030	Faith	And grieve not the holy Spirit of God , whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption .
66003003	Recommendation	Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard , and hold fast , and repent . If therefore thou shalt not watch , I will come on thee as a thief , and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee .

62004001	Recommendation	Beloved , believe not every spirit , but try the spirits whether they are of God : because many false prophets are gone out into the world .
44013038	Grace	Be it known unto you therefore , men and brethren , that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins :
50003001	Recommendation	Finally , my brethren , rejoice in the Lord . To write the same things to you , to me indeed is not grievous , but for you it is safe .

46012031	Faith	But covet earnestly the best gifts : and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way .
58007026	Description	For such an high priest became us , who is holy , harmless , undefiled , separate from sinners , and made higher than the heavens ;
50004013	Faith	I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me .
52004003	Recommendation	For this is the will of God , even your sanctification , that ye should abstain from fornication :

44007029	Description	Then fled Moses at this saying , and was a stranger in the land of Madian , where he begat two sons .
46011007	Description	For a man indeed ought not to cover his head , forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God : but the woman is the glory of the man .
51003015	Faith	And let the peace of God rule in your hearts , to the which also ye are called in one body ; and be ye thankful .
58002010	Grace	For it became him , for whom are all things , and by whom are all things , in bringing many sons unto glory , to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings .
59004001	Sin	From whence come wars and fightings among you ? come they not hence , even of your lusts that war in your members ?
46005001	Sin	It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you , and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles , that one should have his father's wife .
46010013	Faith	There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man : but God is faithful , who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able ; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape , that ye may be able to bear it .
44020029	Violence	For I know this , that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you , not sparing the flock .
53001004	Faith	So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure :
62004012	Faith	No man hath seen God at any time . If we love one another , God dwelleth in us , and his love is perfected in us .
48001001	Description	Paul , an apostle , ( not of men , neither by man , but by Jesus Christ , and God the Father , who raised him from the dead ; )

56003001	Recommendation	Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers , to obey magistrates , to be ready to every good work ,
61003005	Sin	For this they willingly are ignorant of , that by the word of God the heavens were of old , and the earth standing out of the water and in the water :
60003018	Grace	For Christ also hath once suffered for sins , the just for the unjust , that he might bring us to God , being put to death in the flesh , but quickened by the Spirit :
61002021	Sin	For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness , than , after they have known it , to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them .
53003006	Recommendation	Now we command you , brethren , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly , and not after the tradition which he received of us .

58011033	Faith	Who through faith subdued kingdoms , wrought righteousness , obtained promises , stopped the mouths of lions ,
47004009	Faith	Persecuted , but not forsaken ; cast down , but not destroyed ;
59004004	Sin	Ye adulterers and adulteresses , know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God ? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God .

48005026	Recommendation	Let us not be desirous of vain glory , provoking one another , envying one another .
54005001	Recommendation	Rebuke not an elder , but intreat him as a father ; and the younger men as brethren ;
60002012	Recommendation	Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles : that , whereas they speak against you as evildoers , they may by your good works , which they shall behold , glorify God in the day of visitation .

43019012	Description	And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him : but the Jews cried out , saying , If thou let this man go , thou art not Caesar's friend : whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar .
43014001	Faith	Let not your heart be troubled : ye believe in God , believe also in me .
50001028	Faith	And in nothing terrified by your adversaries : which is to them an evident token of perdition , but to you of salvation , and that of God .
43015016	Grace	Ye have not chosen me , but I have chosen you , and ordained you , that ye should go and bring forth fruit , and that your fruit should remain : that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name , he may give it you .
58011004	Faith	By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain , by which he obtained witness that he was righteous , God testifying of his gifts : and by it he being dead yet speaketh .
46004001	Recommendation	Let a man so account of us , as of the ministers of Christ , and stewards of the mysteries of God .
66006013	Description	And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth , even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs , when she is shaken of a mighty wind .

55002014	Recommendation	Of these things put them in remembrance , charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit , but to the subverting of the hearers .
59004008	Recommendation	Draw nigh to God , and he will draw nigh to you . Cleanse your hands , ye sinners ; and purify your hearts , ye double minded .
59002009	Sin	But if ye have respect to persons , ye commit sin , and are convinced of the law as transgressors .
52004007	Grace	For God hath not called us unto uncleanness , but unto holiness .
45001018	Sin	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men , who hold the truth in unrighteousness ;
62004007	Faith	Beloved , let us love one another : for love is of God ; and every one that loveth is born of God , and knoweth God .
62002009	Sin	He that saith he is in the light , and hateth his brother , is in darkness even until now .
60004014	Grace	If ye be reproached for the name of Christ , happy are ye ; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you : on their part he is evil spoken of , but on your part he is glorified .
44021019	Grace	And when he had saluted them , he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry .
43008046	Sin	Which of you convinceth me of sin ? And if I say the truth , why do ye not believe me ?

59003009	Faith	Therewith bless we God , even the Father ; and therewith curse we men , which are made after the similitude of God .
46005010	Sin	Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world , or with the covetous , or extortioners , or with idolaters ; for then must ye needs go out of the world .
44026009	Sin	I verily thought with myself , that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth .

43010012	Description	But he that is an hireling , and not the shepherd , whose own the sheep are not , seeth the wolf coming , and leaveth the sheep , and fleeth : and the wolf catcheth them , and scattereth the sheep .

46009014	Recommendation	Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel .

43014015	Recommendation	If ye love me , keep my commandments .
58012025	Recommendation	See that ye refuse not him that speaketh . For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth , much more shall not we escape , if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven :
48004008	Sin	Howbeit then , when ye knew not God , ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods .
44003026	Grace	Unto you first God , having raised up his Son Jesus , sent him to bless you , in turning away every one of you from his iniquities .
44010039	Violence	And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews , and in Jerusalem ; whom they slew and hanged on a tree :
46001010	Recommendation	Now I beseech you , brethren , by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that ye all speak the same thing , and that there be no divisions among you ; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment .

43004010	Grace	Jesus answered and said unto her , If thou knewest the gift of God , and who it is that saith to thee , Give me to drink ; thou wouldest have asked of him , and he would have given thee living water .
51003004	Grace	When Christ , who is our life , shall appear , then shall ye also appear with him in glory .
43020031	Faith	But these are written , that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God ; and that believing ye might have life through his name .
62004006	Faith	We are of God : he that knoweth God heareth us ; he that is not of God heareth not us . Hereby know we the spirit of truth , and the spirit of error .
65001012	Description	These are spots in your feasts of charity , when they feast with you , feeding themselves without fear : clouds they are without water , carried about of winds ; trees whose fruit withereth , without fruit , twice dead , plucked up by the roots ;
44005015	Description	Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets , and laid them on beds and couches , that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them .
49006016	Faith	Above all , taking the shield of faith , wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked .
51003023	Recommendation	And whatsoever ye do , do it heartily , as to the Lord , and not unto men ;
58012016	Recommendation	Lest there be any fornicator , or profane person , as Esau , who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright .
43018040	Sin	Then cried they all again , saying , Not this man , but Barabbas . Now Barabbas was a robber .
55003004	Sin	Traitors , heady , highminded , lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God ;
50002009	Grace	Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him , and given him a name which is above every name :
61001016	Description	For we have not followed cunningly devised fables , when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , but were eyewitnesses of his majesty .
61003016	Sin	As also in all his epistles , speaking in them of these things ; in which are some things hard to be understood , which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest , as they do also the other scriptures , unto their own destruction .
44014014	Description	Which when the apostles , Barnabas and Paul , heard of , they rent their clothes , and ran in among the people , crying out ,
45015008	Faith	Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God , to confirm the promises made unto the fathers :
59001026	Sin	If any man among you seem to be religious , and bridleth not his tongue , but deceiveth his own heart , this man's religion is vain .
43015020	Recommendation	Remember the word that I said unto you , The servant is not greater than his lord . If they have persecuted me , they will also persecute you ; if they have kept my saying , they will keep yours also .
43008031	Faith	Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him , If ye continue in my word , then are ye my disciples indeed ;

44027034	Recommendation	Wherefore I pray you to take some meat : for this is for your health : for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you .
66002003	Faith	And hast borne , and hast patience , and for my name's sake hast laboured , and hast not fainted .
56002002	Recommendation	That the aged men be sober , grave , temperate , sound in faith , in charity , in patience .
44017030	Recommendation	And the times of this ignorance God winked at ; but now commandeth all men every where to repent :
43019025	Description	Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother , and his mother's sister , Mary the wife of Cleophas , and Mary Magdalene .
66019013	Description	And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood : and his name is called The Word of God .
46008009	Recommendation	But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak .
44013034	Grace	And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead , now no more to return to corruption , he said on this wise , I will give you the sure mercies of David .
43014020	Faith	At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father , and ye in me , and I in you .
62002003	Faith	And hereby we do know that we know him , if we keep his commandments .
43008024	Sin	I said therefore unto you , that ye shall die in your sins : for if ye believe not that I am he , ye shall die in your sins .
66017006	Sin	And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints , and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus : and when I saw her , I wondered with great admiration .
58012017	Description	For ye know how that afterward , when he would have inherited the blessing , he was rejected : for he found no place of repentance , though he sought it carefully with tears .
43007012	Description	And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him : for some said , He is a good man : others said , Nay ; but he deceiveth the people .
44011021	Faith	And the hand of the Lord was with them : and a great number believed , and turned unto the Lord .
52002004	Faith	But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel , even so we speak ; not as pleasing men , but God , which trieth our hearts .
46015057	Grace	But thanks be to God , which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ .
54005005	Faith	Now she that is a widow indeed , and desolate , trusteth in God , and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day .

46007021	Recommendation	Art thou called being a servant ? care not for it : but if thou mayest be made free , use it rather .
65001019	Sin	These be they who separate themselves , sensual , having not the Spirit .
48001006	Sin	I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel :
58012014	Recommendation	Follow peace with all men , and holiness , without which no man shall see the Lord :
43021006	Description	And he said unto them , Cast the net on the right side of the ship , and ye shall find . They cast therefore , and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes .
46007019	Recommendation	Circumcision is nothing , and uncircumcision is nothing , but the keeping of the commandments of God .
45012008	Recommendation	Or he that exhorteth , on exhortation : he that giveth , let him do it with simplicity ; he that ruleth , with diligence ; he that sheweth mercy , with cheerfulness .
44019002	Faith	He said unto them , Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed ? And they said unto him , We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost .
53003014	Recommendation	And if any man obey not our word by this epistle , note that man , and have no company with him , that he may be ashamed .
46015050	Sin	Now this I say , brethren , that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God ; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption .
43006027	Recommendation	Labour not for the meat which perisheth , but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life , which the Son of man shall give unto you : for him hath God the Father sealed .

66014005	Description	And in their mouth was found no guile : for they are without fault before the throne of God .
44024014	Faith	But this I confess unto thee , that after the way which they call heresy , so worship I the God of my fathers , believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets :
45013008	Recommendation	Owe no man any thing , but to love one another : for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law .
66016009	Sin	And men were scorched with great heat , and blasphemed the name of God , which hath power over these plagues : and they repented not to give him glory .
66021012	Description	And had a wall great and high , and had twelve gates , and at the gates twelve angels , and names written thereon , which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel :
48003013	Grace	Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law , being made a curse for us : for it is written , Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree :
48001013	Sin	For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion , how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God , and wasted it :
66020002	Description	And he laid hold on the dragon , that old serpent , which is the Devil , and Satan , and bound him a thousand years ,
44008009	Description	But there was a certain man , called Simon , which beforetime in the same city used sorcery , and bewitched the people of Samaria , giving out that himself was some great one :
50003010	Faith	That I may know him , and the power of his resurrection , and the fellowship of his sufferings , being made conformable unto his death ;
54005022	Recommendation	Lay hands suddenly on no man , neither be partaker of other men's sins : keep thyself pure .
56002003	Recommendation	The aged women likewise , that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness , not false accusers , not given to much wine , teachers of good things ;
46007038	Recommendation	So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well ; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better .
59001022	Recommendation	But be ye doers of the word , and not hearers only , deceiving your own selves .
43007001	Violence	After these things Jesus walked in Galilee : for he would not walk in Jewry , because the Jews sought to kill him .
46001030	Grace	But of him are ye in Christ Jesus , who of God is made unto us wisdom , and righteousness , and sanctification , and redemption :
43013005	Description	After that he poureth water into a bason , and began to wash the disciples' feet , and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded .
44022004	Violence	And I persecuted this way unto the death , binding and delivering into prisons both men and women .
43007043	Description	So there was a division among the people because of him .
60005002	Recommendation	Feed the flock of God which is among you , taking the oversight thereof , not by constraint , but willingly ; not for filthy lucre , but of a ready mind ;
46015056	Sin	The sting of death is sin ; and the strength of sin is the law .
59005004	Sin	Behold , the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields , which is of you kept back by fraud , crieth : and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth .
60002001	Recommendation	Wherefore laying aside all malice , and all guile , and hypocrisies , and envies , and all evil speakings ,
46007039	Recommendation	The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth ; but if her husband be dead , she is at liberty to be married to whom she will ; only in the Lord .
55002018	Sin	Who concerning the truth have erred , saying that the resurrection is past already ; and overthrow the faith of some .
48005006	Faith	For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything , nor uncircumcision ; but faith which worketh by love .
58005009	Grace	And being made perfect , he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him ;
46016001	Recommendation	Now concerning the collection for the saints , as I have given order to the churches of Galatia , even so do ye .

65001017	Recommendation	But , beloved , remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ ;
44017025	Grace	Neither is worshipped with men's hands , as though he needed any thing , seeing he giveth to all life , and breath , and all things ;
62005009	Faith	If we receive the witness of men , the witness of God is greater : for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son .
45013014	Faith	But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ , and make not provision for the flesh , to fulfil the lusts thereof .
58011030	Description	By faith the walls of Jericho fell down , after they were compassed about seven days .

43010019	Description	There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings .
43003033	Faith	He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true .
61003014	Recommendation	Wherefore , beloved , seeing that ye look for such things , be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace , without spot , and blameless .
53003001	Faith	Finally , brethren , pray for us , that the word of the Lord may have free course , and be glorified , even as it is with you :
47004014	Faith	Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus , and shall present us with you .
59005014	Recommendation	Is any sick among you ? let him call for the elders of the church ; and let them pray over him , anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord :
44007023	Description	And when he was full forty years old , it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel .
44023027	Violence	This man was taken of the Jews , and should have been killed of them : then came I with an army , and rescued him , having understood that he was a Roman .
44019029	Description	And the whole city was filled with confusion : and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus , men of Macedonia , Paul's companions in travel , they rushed with one accord into the theatre .
44003014	Sin	But ye denied the Holy One and the Just , and desired a murderer to be granted unto you ;
44015009	Faith	And put no difference between us and them , purifying their hearts by faith .
46011028	Recommendation	But let a man examine himself , and so let him eat of that bread , and drink of that cup .
46015058	Faith	Therefore , my beloved brethren , be ye stedfast , unmoveable , always abounding in the work of the Lord , forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord .
46004016	Recommendation	Wherefore I beseech you , be ye followers of me .
46001021	Faith	For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God , it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe .
60003001	Recommendation	Likewise , ye wives , be in subjection to your own husbands ; that , if any obey not the word , they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives ;
47005020	Recommendation	Now then we are ambassadors for Christ , as though God did beseech you by us : we pray you in Christ's stead , be ye reconciled to God .
44002024	Description	Whom God hath raised up , having loosed the pains of death : because it was not possible that he should be holden of it .
59002007	Sin	Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called ?
54003003	Description	Not given to wine , no striker , not greedy of filthy lucre ; but patient , not a brawler , not covetous ;
43004014	Grace	But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst ; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life .
62002005	Faith	But whoso keepeth his word , in him verily is the love of God perfected : hereby know we that we are in him .
66016013	Description	And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon , and out of the mouth of the beast , and out of the mouth of the false prophet .
59002008	Recommendation	If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture , Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself , ye do well :
47004005	Faith	For we preach not ourselves , but Christ Jesus the Lord ; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake .
46015033	Recommendation	Be not deceived : evil communications corrupt good manners .
58013020	Grace	Now the God of peace , that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus , that great shepherd of the sheep , through the blood of the everlasting covenant ,
50001027	Recommendation	Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ : that whether I come and see you , or else be absent , I may hear of your affairs , that ye stand fast in one spirit , with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel ;
46006014	Grace	And God hath both raised up the Lord , and will also raise up us by his own power .
55001006	Recommendation	Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God , which is in thee by the putting on of my hands .
60004006	Grace	For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead , that they might be judged according to men in the flesh , but live according to God in the spirit .
46007023	Recommendation	Ye are bought with a price ; be not ye the servants of men .
46010010	Recommendation	Neither murmur ye , as some of them also murmured , and were destroyed of the destroyer .
47002017	Faith	For we are not as many , which corrupt the word of God : but as of sincerity , but as of God , in the sight of God speak we in Christ .
45015001	Recommendation	We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak , and not to please ourselves .
50002024	Faith	But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly .
66007001	Description	And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth , holding the four winds of the earth , that the wind should not blow on the earth , nor on the sea , nor on any tree .
60004003	Sin	For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles , when we walked in lasciviousness , lusts , excess of wine , revellings , banquetings , and abominable idolatries :
66011005	Violence	And if any man will hurt them , fire proceedeth out of their mouth , and devoureth their enemies : and if any man will hurt them , he must in this manner be killed .
44023005	Recommendation	Then said Paul , I wist not , brethren , that he was the high priest : for it is written , Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people .
66022015	Sin	For without are dogs , and sorcerers , and whoremongers , and murderers , and idolaters , and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie .
66002014	Sin	But I have a few things against thee , because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam , who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel , to eat things sacrificed unto idols , and to commit fornication .
53001003	Faith	We are bound to thank God always for you , brethren , as it is meet , because that your faith groweth exceedingly , and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth ;
46012002	Sin	Ye know that ye were Gentiles , carried away unto these dumb idols , even as ye were led .
49005025	Recommendation	Husbands , love your wives , even as Christ also loved the church , and gave himself for it ;
45012017	Recommendation	Recompense to no man evil for evil . Provide things honest in the sight of all men .
60005006	Recommendation	Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God , that he may exalt you in due time :
44014017	Grace	Nevertheless he left not himself without witness , in that he did good , and gave us rain from heaven , and fruitful seasons , filling our hearts with food and gladness .
54003011	Recommendation	Even so must their wives be grave , not slanderers , sober , faithful in all things .
66002021	Sin	And I gave her space to repent of her fornication ; and she repented not .
44012020	Description	And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon : but they came with one accord to him , and , having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend , desired peace ; because their country was nourished by the king's country .
43008049	Sin	Jesus answered , I have not a devil ; but I honour my Father , and ye do dishonour me .
43006018	Description	And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew .
45008018	Faith	For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us .
62002012	Grace	I write unto you , little children , because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake .
55001009	Grace	Who hath saved us , and called us with an holy calling , not according to our works , but according to his own purpose and grace , which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began ,
43019006	Violence	When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him , they cried out , saying , Crucify him , crucify him . Pilate saith unto them , Take ye him , and crucify him : for I find no fault in him .
60001010	Grace	Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently , who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you :
63001007	Sin	For many deceivers are entered into the world , who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh . This is a deceiver and an antichrist .
44024005	Sin	For we have found this man a pestilent fellow , and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world , and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes :
54003016	Grace	And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness : God was manifest in the flesh , justified in the Spirit , seen of angels , preached unto the Gentiles , believed on in the world , received up into glory .
66016021	Violence	And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven , every stone about the weight of a talent : and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail ; for the plague thereof was exceeding great .
61003013	Faith	Nevertheless we , according to his promise , look for new heavens and a new earth , wherein dwelleth righteousness .
66006014	Description	And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together ; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places .
58010010	Grace	By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all .
52001002	Faith	We give thanks to God always for you all , making mention of you in our prayers ;
66006004	Violence	And there went out another horse that was red : and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth , and that they should kill one another : and there was given unto him a great sword .
54006001	Recommendation	Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour , that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed .
51003009	Recommendation	Lie not one to another , seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds ;
66002020	Sin	Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee , because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel , which calleth herself a prophetess , to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication , and to eat things sacrificed unto idols .
48003008	Grace	And the scripture , foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith , preached before the gospel unto Abraham , saying , In thee shall all nations be blessed .
58012005	Recommendation	And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children , My son , despise not thou the chastening of the Lord , nor faint when thou art rebuked of him :
58013017	Recommendation	Obey them that have the rule over you , and submit yourselves : for they watch for your souls , as they that must give account , that they may do it with joy , and not with grief : for that is unprofitable for you .
44013019	Description	And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan , he divided their land to them by lot .
54006003	Faith	If any man teach otherwise , and consent not to wholesome words , even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ , and to the doctrine which is according to godliness ;
63001010	Recommendation	If there come any unto you , and bring not this doctrine , receive him not into your house , neither bid him God speed :
47001005	Grace	For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us , so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ .
65001011	Sin	Woe unto them ! for they have gone in the way of Cain , and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward , and perished in the gainsaying of Core .
65001010	Sin	But these speak evil of those things which they know not : but what they know naturally , as brute beasts , in those things they corrupt themselves .
58011007	Faith	By faith Noah , being warned of God of things not seen as yet , moved with fear , prepared an ark to the saving of his house ; by the which he condemned the world , and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith .
58009006	Description	Now when these things were thus ordained , the priests went always into the first tabernacle , accomplishing the service of God .
44007051	Sin	Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears , ye do always resist the Holy Ghost : as your fathers did , so do ye .
54001009	Sin	Knowing this , that the law is not made for a righteous man , but for the lawless and disobedient , for the ungodly and for sinners , for unholy and profane , for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers , for manslayers ,
46005009	Recommendation	I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators :
48001015	Grace	But when it pleased God , who separated me from my mother's womb , and called me by his grace ,
45007015	Description	For that which I do I allow not : for what I would , that do I not ; but what I hate , that do I .
61003018	Faith	But grow in grace , and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ . To him be glory both now and for ever . Amen .
46004010	Description	We are fools for Christ's sake , but ye are wise in Christ ; we are weak , but ye are strong ; ye are honourable , but we are despised .
60005009	Faith	Whom resist stedfast in the faith , knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world .
51003022	Recommendation	Servants , obey in all things your masters according to the flesh ; not with eyeservice , as menpleasers ; but in singleness of heart , fearing God :
66017012	Description	And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings , which have received no kingdom as yet ; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast .
46002012	Grace	Now we have received , not the spirit of the world , but the spirit which is of God ; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God .
59005001	Recommendation	Go to now , ye rich men , weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you .
66002010	Recommendation	Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer : behold , the devil shall cast some of you into prison , that ye may be tried ; and ye shall have tribulation ten days : be thou faithful unto death , and I will give thee a crown of life .
54006011	Recommendation	But thou , O man of God , flee these things ; and follow after righteousness , godliness , faith , love , patience , meekness .
59005005	Sin	Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth , and been wanton ; ye have nourished your hearts , as in a day of slaughter .
66004004	Description	And round about the throne were four and twenty seats : and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting , clothed in white raiment ; and they had on their heads crowns of gold .
66018007	Description	How much she hath glorified herself , and lived deliciously , so much torment and sorrow give her : for she saith in her heart , I sit a queen , and am no widow , and shall see no sorrow .
60003007	Recommendation	Likewise , ye husbands , dwell with them according to knowledge , giving honour unto the wife , as unto the weaker vessel , and as being heirs together of the grace of life ; that your prayers be not hindered .
54002012	Recommendation	But I suffer not a woman to teach , nor to usurp authority over the man , but to be in silence .
46001009	Faith	God is faithful , by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord .
48005013	Recommendation	For , brethren , ye have been called unto liberty ; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh , but by love serve one another .
59002012	Recommendation	So speak ye , and so do , as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty .
46012005	Faith	And there are differences of administrations , but the same Lord .
45009005	Description	Whose are the fathers , and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came , who is over all , God blessed for ever . Amen .
47001006	Description	And whether we be afflicted , it is for your consolation and salvation , which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer : or whether we be comforted , it is for your consolation and salvation .
47001021	Faith	Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ , and hath anointed us , is God ;
44010015	Recommendation	And the voice spake unto him again the second time , What God hath cleansed , that call not thou common .
66018009	Sin	And the kings of the earth , who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her , shall bewail her , and lament for her , when they shall see the smoke of her burning ,
43014023	Faith	Jesus answered and said unto him , If a man love me , he will keep my words : and my Father will love him , and we will come unto him , and make our abode with him .
62004010	Grace	Herein is love , not that we loved God , but that he loved us , and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins .
62001007	Faith	But if we walk in the light , as he is in the light , we have fellowship one with another , and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin .
48004007	Grace	Wherefore thou art no more a servant , but a son ; and if a son , then an heir of God through Christ .
58001008	Faith	But unto the Son he saith , Thy throne , O God , is for ever and ever : a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom .
43010033	Sin	The Jews answered him , saying , For a good work we stone thee not ; but for blasphemy ; and because that thou , being a man , makest thyself God .
66014011	Description	And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever : and they have no rest day nor night , who worship the beast and his image , and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name .
47004001	Faith	Therefore seeing we have this ministry , as we have received mercy , we faint not ;
58013006	Faith	So that we may boldly say , The Lord is my helper , and I will not fear what man shall do unto me .
45014003	Recommendation	Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not ; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth : for God hath received him .
45015005	Grace	Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus :
58007027	Description	Who needeth not daily , as those high priests , to offer up sacrifice , first for his own sins , and then for the people's : for this he did once , when he offered up himself .
62003017	Sin	But whoso hath this world's good , and seeth his brother have need , and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him , how dwelleth the love of God in him ?
47005008	Faith	We are confident , I say , and willing rather to be absent from the body , and to be present with the Lord .
60002011	Recommendation	Dearly beloved , I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims , abstain from fleshly lusts , which war against the soul ;
60002017	Recommendation	Honour all men . Love the brotherhood . Fear God . Honour the king .
44007025	Description	For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them : but they understood not .
50003002	Violence	Beware of dogs , beware of evil workers , beware of the concision .
56001016	Sin	They profess that they know God ; but in works they deny him , being abominable , and disobedient , and unto every good work reprobate .
45010002	Faith	For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God , but not according to knowledge .
47001004	Grace	Who comforteth us in all our tribulation , that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble , by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God .
55002015	Recommendation	Study to shew thyself approved unto God , a workman that needeth not to be ashamed , rightly dividing the word of truth .
53002004	Description	Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God , or that is worshipped ; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God , shewing himself that he is God .
49006004	Recommendation	And , ye fathers , provoke not your children to wrath : but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord .
45008037	Grace	Nay , in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us .
44026014	Violence	And when we were all fallen to the earth , I heard a voice speaking unto me , and saying in the Hebrew tongue , Saul , Saul , why persecutest thou me ? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks .
66002009	Sin	I know thy works , and tribulation , and poverty , ( but thou art rich ) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews , and are not , but are the synagogue of Satan .
46013006	Faith	Rejoiceth not in iniquity , but rejoiceth in the truth ;
59001021	Recommendation	Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness , and receive with meekness the engrafted word , which is able to save your souls .
46003006	Grace	I have planted , Apollos watered ; but God gave the increase .
66014008	Sin	And there followed another angel , saying , Babylon is fallen , is fallen , that great city , because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication .
43015014	Recommendation	Ye are my friends , if ye do whatsoever I command you .
62005021	Recommendation	Little children , keep yourselves from idols . Amen .
55003006	Sin	For of this sort are they which creep into houses , and lead captive silly women laden with sins , led away with divers lusts ,
49004015	Faith	But speaking the truth in love , may grow up into him in all things , which is the head , even Christ :
49004003	Faith	Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace .
44009005	Description	And he said , Who art thou , Lord ? And the Lord said , I am Jesus whom thou persecutest : it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks .
60003015	Recommendation	But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts : and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear :
44007033	Recommendation	Then said the Lord to him , Put off thy shoes from thy feet : for the place where thou standest is holy ground .
62002024	Faith	Let that therefore abide in you , which ye have heard from the beginning . If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you , ye also shall continue in the Son , and in the Father .
43008051	Faith	Verily , verily , I say unto you , If a man keep my saying , he shall never see death .
66020011	Description	And I saw a great white throne , and him that sat on it , from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away ; and there was found no place for them .
46006013	Recommendation	Meats for the belly , and the belly for meats : but God shall destroy both it and them . Now the body is not for fornication , but for the Lord ; and the Lord for the body .
45006011	Faith	Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin , but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord .
47002014	Faith	Now thanks be unto God , which always causeth us to triumph in Christ , and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place .
62001005	Grace	This then is the message which we have heard of him , and declare unto you , that God is light , and in him is no darkness at all .
43006037	Grace	All that the Father giveth me shall come to me ; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out .
58013001	Recommendation	Let brotherly love continue .
58007025	Grace	Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him , seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them .
43019015	Violence	But they cried out , Away with him , away with him , crucify him . Pilate saith unto them , Shall I crucify your King ? The chief priest answered , We have no king but Caesar .
45011005	Grace	Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace .
66017002	Sin	With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication , and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication .
45012010	Recommendation	Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love ; in honour preferring one another ;
45008014	Faith	For as many as are led by the Spirit of God , they are the sons of God .
66012003	Description	And there appeared another wonder in heaven ; and behold a great red dragon , having seven heads and ten horns , and seven crowns upon his heads .
45008017	Faith	And if children , then heirs ; heirs of God , and joint-heirs with Christ ; if so be that we suffer with him , that we may be also glorified together .
54005017	Recommendation	Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour , especially they who labour in the word and doctrine .
46008007	Sin	Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge : for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol ; and their conscience being weak is defiled .
43015002	Grace	Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away : and every branch that beareth fruit , he purgeth it , that it may bring forth more fruit .
60005003	Recommendation	Neither as being lords over God's heritage , but being ensamples to the flock .
52004013	Recommendation	But I would not have you to be ignorant , brethren , concerning them which are asleep , that ye sorrow not , even as others which have no hope .
58011029	Description	By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land : which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned .
44007020	Description	In which time Moses was born , and was exceeding fair , and nourished up in his father's house three months :
58005002	Grace	Who can have compassion on the ignorant , and on them that are out of the way ; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity .
45013012	Recommendation	The night is far spent , the day is at hand : let us therefore cast off the works of darkness , and let us put on the armour of light .
49006009	Recommendation	And , ye masters , do the same things unto them , forbearing threatening : knowing that your Master also is in heaven ; neither is there respect of persons with him .
45012015	Recommendation	Rejoice with them that do rejoice , and weep with them that weep .
45002005	Sin	But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God ;
44014019	Violence	And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium , who persuaded the people , and , having stoned Paul , drew him out of the city , supposing he had been dead .
43013021	Description	When Jesus had thus said , he was troubled in spirit , and testified , and said , Verily , verily , I say unto you , that one of you shall betray me .
48003022	Faith	But the scripture hath concluded all under sin , that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe .
66011007	Violence	And when they shall have finished their testimony , the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them , and shall overcome them , and kill them .
58003014	Faith	For we are made partakers of Christ , if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end ;
45008010	Faith	And if Christ be in you , the body is dead because of sin ; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness .
44007052	Sin	Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted ? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One ; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers :
48005021	Sin	Envyings , murders , drunkenness , revellings , and such like : of the which I tell you before , as I have also told you in time past , that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God .
43012036	Faith	While ye have light , believe in the light , that ye may be the children of light . These things spake Jesus , and departed , and did hide himself from them .
58003002	Faith	Who was faithful to him that appointed him , as also Moses was faithful in all his house .
56003006	Grace	Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour ;
